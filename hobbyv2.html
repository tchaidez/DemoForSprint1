<h1>My Favorite Hobby</h1>

<p>

  My favorite hobby has to be dancing for sure. Not just any dancing, although I do like all kinds, but dances popular in Northern Mexico to be specific.

   I find it interesting because in Northern Mexico, where my family orginates from, certain types of music are very popular, such as Banda, Norteno, Ranchera, Duranguense, Zapateado, and Cumbia. There are dances that go with each genre, although there is alot of overlap

   My proudest hobby accomplishment has to be in 2014, where I went to Mexico in the summer with two left legs, and through alot of practice and dances that went on in the two weeks I was there, managed to come back to the states competent enough no to embarrass myself at the big dances.

  Someone could get into this hobby by looking up when big bandas, grupos, or individual artists in the genres I mentioned come into Chicago to play, and just going to one of their concerts and watch how everyone is dancing, it's not too complex once the rhytm is accquired.

The songs will all be in Spanish, and alot of people will look like cowboys with cowboy hats, cowboy boots, belts and more, but don't let that intimidate you from going.
